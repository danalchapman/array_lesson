# My Self Evaluation Thus Far

1. After spending some time with my fellow students, I am feeling much more comfortable with Arrays and Array methods! While I am not 100% yet with the material, I know more than I did at the beginning of the day.
1. I definitely see myself spending more time on Concatenation vs. Interpolation as I struggled with the ideas off the bat this morning after the daily scrum.
1. With Arrays in particular, I feel that I just need to better familiar myself with Boolean variables in particular, and also the handful of Array methods we'e been introduced to so far.

- The challenge has been well worth it!
